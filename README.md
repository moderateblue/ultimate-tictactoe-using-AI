**~~Previous phase of development: implementing a user interface~~**
> ~~trying to make my originally text-based tic-tac-toe into an interactable game screen~~

<br>

**current phase of development: implementing AI**
> ~~determining the model/algorithm to use for the agent~~

> implementing a neural network model
