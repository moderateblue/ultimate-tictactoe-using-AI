# ultimate tictactoe using AI
WIP project (basically done, the AI is not as good as I like it to be but it works I think)

referenced [r-3than's project](https://github.com/r-3than/Ultimate-tic-tac-toe/tree/master) to learn pygame

referenced [Coding Spot's "I Coded Tic Tac Toe but ULTIMATE!" YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE4imG5aqpU) and their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AlejoG10/python-ultimate-tictactoe-yt) for extra pygame help

referenced [Shayak Banerjee's Medium Article](https://medium.com/@shayak_89588/playing-ultimate-tic-tac-toe-with-reinforcement-learning-7bea5b9d7252) and their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/shayakbanerjee/ultimate-ttt-rl/tree/master) for implementing a neural network

**~~Previous phase of development: implementing a user interface~~**
> ~~trying to make my originally text-based tic-tac-toe into an interactable game screen~~

<br>

**current phase of development: implementing AI**
> ~~determining the model/algorithm to use for the agent~~

> ~~implementing a neural network model~~

> train the neural network model
